For now, Charm is **deprecated**. While I like the idea of an immediate-mode UI builder, I've never been satisfied with the result. Future UI exploration will likely focus on retained mode UI, and it will be with a separate library in a separate repo.

Charm
=====
Charm is a library for LÃ–VE that makes it easier to arrange and draw graphics, such as shapes, images, and text. It's great for managing complex layouts with specific alignment and grouping needs.

Example

```lua
function love.draw()
	layout
		:new 'transform'
			:beginChildren()
				:new('rectangle', 0, 0, 300, 250)
					:beginChildren()
						:new('paragraph', font, text, 280, 'left', 10, 10 - textScrollY)
							:color(0, 0, 0)
						textHeight = layout:get('@current', 'height')
					layout:endChildren()
					:fillColor(.8, .8, .8)
					:clip()
			:endChildren()
			:left(100):top(100)
			:scale(animationProgress)
			:angle((1 + animationProgress) * math.pi)
		:draw()
end
```

Installation
------------
To use Charm, place charm.lua in your project, and then `require` it in each file where you need to use it:
